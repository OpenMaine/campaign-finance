# Whoa, how do I make a local ('my own') copy of these files?

First, just look at the green "Clone or download" button on the upper
left. You can "Download ZIP" to get your own copy this way.

If you will be contributing, see some info here:
https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository
(but, alas, there is much more to learn)

Nutshell process to contribute code, w/o branching, on the command line:
1. Clone repo, as described in the link above
  you now have a local copy, in a new directory called
	"Campaign-Finance" 
2. cd into that directory
3. edit
4. (check your work!)
5. here's how to push it back up:
```
git add .
git commit -m 'message about what I did'
git push
```

The first line adds all your changes, to a staging area.
The second line 'commits' those; make sure you include a meaningful message.
The last line actually makes the changes on GitHub.

I don't ever use the desktop client, so can't help you there.

Also, there is tons to learn about branching, which is the better way to
work.
